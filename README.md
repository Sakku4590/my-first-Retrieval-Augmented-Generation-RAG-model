# 📚 my-first-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-model

This is a beginner-friendly implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, focused on question answering over a PDF textbook. It uses the *Human Nutrition: 2020 Edition* as its knowledge base and combines state-of-the-art language models with document retrieval techniques.

## 🧠 What is RAG?

RAG combines a retriever (which finds relevant documents) with a generator (which formulates answers) to provide grounded, context-aware responses. It is especially useful for question answering over large documents.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

### ✅ Objective:
To build an end-to-end RAG system that can:
- Ingest a textbook (`human-nutrition-text.pdf`)
- Split the content into manageable text chunks
- Generate dense embeddings
- Use similarity search to retrieve relevant chunks
- Answer user questions using a pre-trained generative model

### 📄 Input:
- A long PDF file on human nutrition
- User queries (e.g., "What are macronutrients?", "What is the function of Vitamin C?")

### 📤 Output:
- Answers grounded in retrieved sections from the document

---

## 🛠️ Features

- PDF parsing using `PyMuPDF`
- Text chunking and cleaning
- Embedding generation using `sentence-transformers`
- Retrieval using cosine similarity
- Context-aware answer generation with HuggingFace Transformers
- Streamlined with `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` for analysis/visualization

📊 Example
User: What are micronutrients?
Answer: Micronutrients include essential minerals and vitamins that are needed in small amounts but are crucial for proper body function. They support enzyme function, immune system health, and more.
